# Usage
Inside the tasqer folder, execute:

    $ bundle

And then, to make ```bin/manager``` an executable file, run:

    $ chmod +x bin/manager

And then execute from terminal:

    $ bin/manager

PS: The command ```chmod +x bin/manager``` doesn't work on ```windows```, use:

    $ ruby bin/manager instead
